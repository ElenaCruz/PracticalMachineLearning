Five different fashions for the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl have been considered:

* Class A:exactly according to the specification <- "OK"

* Class B:throwing the elbows to the front <- "NoOK"

* Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway <- "NoOK"

* Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway <- "NoOK"

* Class E: throwing the hips to the front <- "NoOK"

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
