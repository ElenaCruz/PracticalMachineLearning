Five different fashions for the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl have been considered:

* Class A:exactly according to the specification <- "OK"

* Class B:throwing the elbows to the front <- "NoOK"

* Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway <- "NoOK"

* Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway <- "NoOK"

* Class E: throwing the hips to the front <- "NoOK"
